Tag Formatter
=============
**Tag Formatter** (for a lack of a better name) is—of course—a Ruby gem that takes in text input with "tags", and replaces those tags with text as defined by the programmer.

Any and all issues should be reported via the Issues tab in Github.

Fixes, additions, patches, etc. are greatly welcome.
